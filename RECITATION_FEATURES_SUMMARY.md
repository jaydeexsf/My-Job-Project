# Recitation Features Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive recitation management system with the following features:
- **Latest Recitations View**: Users can see the most recent recitations
- **Rating System**: Users can rate recitations from 1-5 stars
- **Bookmark System**: Users can bookmark their favorite recitations
- **Top Rated View**: Enhanced rankings view showing top-rated recitations

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Models (`src/lib/models.ts`)
Updated `CompetitionRecitation` schema to include:
- `ratings`: Array of user ratings with userId, rating (1-5), and timestamp
- `averageRating`: Calculated average rating (0-5)
- `ratingCount`: Total number of ratings
- `bookmarkedBy`: Array of user IDs who bookmarked the recitation
- Added index on `averageRating` for efficient sorting

### 2. API Endpoints Created

#### `/api/competition/rate` (POST)
- Allows users to rate a recitation (1-5 stars)
- Updates existing rating if user already rated
- Automatically recalculates average rating and rating count
- **Request**: `{ recitationId, userId, rating }`
- **Response**: `{ success, data: { averageRating, ratingCount, userRating } }`

#### `/api/competition/bookmark` (POST & GET)
- **POST**: Toggle bookmark for a recitation
  - Request: `{ recitationId, userId }`
  - Response: `{ success, data: { isBookmarked, bookmarkCount } }`
- **GET**: Fetch user's bookmarked recitations
  - Query: `?userId=xxx`
  - Response: `{ success, data: [recitations] }`

#### `/api/competition/latest` (GET)
- Fetches latest recitations sorted by creation date
- Query parameters:
  - `limit`: Number of recitations to fetch (default: 20)
  - `surah`: Optional filter by surah number
- Response: `{ success, data: [recitations] }`

### 3. UI Updates (`src/app/recite/page.tsx`)

#### New View Modes
Added 4 view modes with tabs:
1. **Submit Recitation**: Record and submit new recitations
2. **Latest**: View most recent recitations
3. **Top Rated**: View recitations ranked by likes (existing, enhanced)
4. **My Bookmarks**: View user's bookmarked recitations

#### Enhanced Recitation Cards
Each recitation card now displays:
- Surah name and verse number
- Creation date
- Average rating and rating count (if rated)
- Rank badge (for top 3 in rankings view)
- Action buttons:
  - **Like button**: Heart icon with like count
  - **Bookmark button**: Bookmark icon (filled when bookmarked)
  - **Rate button**: Star icon showing user's rating or "Rate" text

#### Rating Modal
- Interactive 5-star rating interface
- Shows current user rating when opening
- Submit or cancel rating
- Updates recitation data in real-time

#### Features
- Filter by Surah (available in Latest and Top Rated views)
- Real-time updates after actions (like, bookmark, rate)
- Visual feedback for user interactions
- Responsive design with color-coded ranking badges

## How It Works

### Rating Flow
1. User clicks "Rate" button on a recitation
2. Modal opens with 5 interactive stars
3. User selects rating (1-5 stars)
4. Rating is submitted to backend
5. Backend updates ratings array and recalculates average
6. UI refreshes to show updated rating

### Bookmark Flow
1. User clicks bookmark button
2. Backend toggles bookmark status
3. If not bookmarked: adds userId to bookmarkedBy array
4. If already bookmarked: removes userId from array
5. UI refreshes to show updated bookmark state

### Latest Recitations
- Automatically loads 20 most recent recitations
- Can be filtered by Surah
- Shows all interaction options (like, bookmark, rate)

### My Bookmarks
- Loads all recitations bookmarked by current user
- Sorted by creation date (newest first)
- Allows unbookmarking directly from this view

## Database Integration
All features are fully integrated with MongoDB:
- Ratings are stored in the recitation document
- Bookmarks are tracked via userId arrays
- Efficient indexing for fast queries
- Atomic updates for data consistency

## User Experience
- **Persistent Data**: All ratings and bookmarks are saved to database
- **User-Specific**: Each user has their own ratings and bookmarks
- **Real-time Updates**: UI updates immediately after actions
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for liked, bookmarked, and rated items
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- Add comments/reviews to recitations
- Implement user profiles
- Add notifications for new recitations
- Create leaderboards for top contributors
- Add sharing functionality
- Implement recitation categories/tags
