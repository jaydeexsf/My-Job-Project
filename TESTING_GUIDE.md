### Common Issues:

**Audio not playing:**

- Try clicking "Restart" button
- Check browser console for errors

**Looping not working:**
- Make sure "Repeat" count is > 1
- Verify verse range is valid (From â‰¤ To)
- Check that audio has segment timing data

**Auto-scroll not working:**
- Ensure audio is playing
- Check that verse is in view (may need to scroll manually first time)
